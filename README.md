# Arma-Reforger-Server-with-Kubernetes-K8S-
Repo for running a Arma Reforger server within Kubernetes! 

Within my homelab I am running a Talos OS cluster running Kubernetes K8S to host multiple applications among them an Arma Reforger server ran fully in Kubernetes. The storage backplane on my server is being run with Longhorn also hosted with Kubernetes. All files posted are free of use and encouraged to be used to learn Kubernetes yourself and host an Arma Reforger server yourself!
